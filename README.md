#Description

I've developed a user-friendly Todo app using React js , Material ui and Css,that leverages local storage to enhance the user experience. With this web app, you can easily store your tasks and manage your daily activities efficiently. One of its standout features is the ability to add,Â  and delete tasks on the go. Not only can you create new tasks, but you can also mark them as complete when you've finished them. This functionality helps you stay organized and track your progress effortlessly. Plus, with the data stored locally, you won't lose your important tasks even if you close the browser or refresh the page. It's a handy tool that simplifies task management and keeps you in control of your to-do list.
